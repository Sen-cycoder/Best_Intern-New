 Best_Intern-New

To hire best intern from datasets
ðŸ“Œ # About The data
This is an exiciting machine learning project to find out best intern from datasets. This datasets include candidate skills, performance,stream and experices and graduation year which we use to find out best candidate.
ðŸ“Œ # Data Preprocessing
Intial steps of datasets is data preprocessing where we handle missing value, duplicates value from datasets. we have to assure that datasets cleans 100%.Then we next steps to fit our model.
# Explore Data Analysis ðŸ“ˆ ðŸ“Š
Data exploration and analysis played a crucial role in gaining insights from the dataset. Various visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, histograms, etc., were employed to understand the data better. Several questions were posed to the data, and functions like value_counts() and group by () were utilized.
ðŸ“Œ # Feautre Scalling
Feautre Scalling is important steps in datasets by which we scale the feautre from datasets . Feauture Scalling is Crusial part in data beacause the performance of the model depends upon that.

ðŸ“Œ # Model Selection
Always right model gaves right result . so, Model selection is import steps in machine learning . I used K means clustering model to cluster the data and based upon that cluster we can identify the candidate . The Model gave 83% accuracy result that is pretty much good model. It may gave more good result if DataSet may incressed and also maybe gave good result to other model.
